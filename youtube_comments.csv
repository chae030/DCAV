@BreakerBinge,Me and my wife met Jennie in LA during Covid. She got in line behind us with 3 or 4 of her dancers at a Korean Tea place. She was super sweet and even hugged my pregnant wife and rubbed her belly. She didn't have to do that especially during the height of Covid. Jennie is the best. Thanks again @Jennie. Our boy is 3 years old now and is doing great.
